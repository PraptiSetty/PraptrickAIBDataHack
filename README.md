# PraptrickAIBDataHack
The project built at AIB Data Hack in November 2017 developed around the concept of promoting smart cities 


The Concept:
-An Interactive map
-Regularly updated information about street signs in Dublin

The Reason we chose this Idea:
-Ideal method to determine what time lights in each area should come on each evening by checking sunset hours of each locality (helps save energy).
-Easy to expand to make “smart street signs” if we have all the street signs mapped out.
-Ideal to use when putting in sensor street lights.

The Next Step:
-Create the smart street signs.
-Place sensors near street signs.
-Expand to map our cities other than Dublin
